## Executive Summary
**FinTrack** is a hyper-localized fintech solution tailored specifically for the Indian student demographic. Unlike generic expense trackers (Splitwise, Jupiter), FinTrack addresses the unique "cash-digital hybrid" economy of college campuses, solving for irregular income, peer-pressure spending, and social debt awkwardness.

This project was conceptualized and designed as part of the **Produscope Case Study Competition**, where it secured a **Top 20 National Rank** among 7,000+ participants.

## The Problem Statement
Through a survey of **1,000+ students**, we identified three critical gaps in existing solutions:
1.  **The "Cash Blindspot":** 21.65% of students struggle to track cash expenses in a UPI-dominant world.
2.  **Social Debt Anxiety:** Students often lose money because asking friends to repay small amounts feels awkward.
3.  **Savings Paralysis:** 39.80% want to save but lack the tools to manage irregular allowances/gig income.

## The Solution (MVP Features)
We utilized the **RICE Framework** to prioritize features that deliver maximum impact with feasible effort.

### 1.  Smart-Save Meter (North Star Feature)
* **What it is:** An automated budgeting tool that splits incoming funds into "Safe to Spend" and "Savings."
* **Key Innovation:** Real-time **Daily Spend Limit** that adjusts dynamically based on yesterday's spending.
* **Why we built it:** To prevent the "month-end broke" phenomenon common in hostels.

### 2.  Clear Dues (Social Debt Tracking)
* **What it is:** A non-confrontational visualization of who owes whom.
* **Key Innovation:** Centralized dashboard for borrowing/lending that removes the need for awkward reminder texts.
* **Impact:** Reduces social friction and "lost" money within friend groups.

### 3.  Cash Lens
* **What it is:** A seamless manual entry interface for cash transactions.
* **Key Innovation:** Bridges the gap between the digital wallet (UPI) and physical wallet, ensuring 100% budget visibility.

##  Product Strategy & Methodology

### User Personas
We designed for three distinct archetypes:
* **Priyal (The Hustler):** Juggling irregular gig income and tuition fees.
* **Souvik (The Social Spender):** Prone to impulse spending and peer pressure.
* **Suraj (The Newcomer):** Intimidated by banking jargon, relies heavily on cash.

##  Go-To-Market Strategy
Our launch plan focuses on **Trust** and **Network Density** over broad advertising:
1.  **Phase 1 (Activation):** Physical booths in 3 strategic college campuses (Tier 1, 2, & 3).
2.  **Trust Building:** Partnerships with campus vendors (canteens/stationery) for exclusive discounts.
3.  **Growth:** Referral programs incentivized to onboard entire hostel wings (creating the network effect needed for *Clear Dues*).
